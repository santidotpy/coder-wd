              <p>
                Food and non-alcoholic beverages see highest spikes as purchasing-power continues to plummet; Prices have risen 56.4% since January with annual projections now nearing 100%.
              </p>
              <p>
                Argentina’s inflation woes continue: consumer prices jumped a massive seven percent in August, official data reveals, and have risen 56.4 percent since the start of the year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The country’s inflation rate remains amongst the highest in the world, data published by the INDEC national statistics bureau confirmed Wednesday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Argentina’s consumer price index (CPI) has recorded an increase of 78.5 percent over the last 12 months, and given the meteoric trajectory, experts and analysts are expecting the 2022 annual figure to end up breaking the triple-digit mark.</p>
              <p>
                  Extraordinary government measures to rein in runaway inflation and the raising of the Central Bank's reference rate to 69.5 percent in August have proved to tamp down runaway price hikes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon taking office last month, Economy Minister Sergio Massa announced that combating inflation represents his and the country’s greatest challenge. Among other decisions, he pivoted on the government’s loose monetary policy and drastically reduced the subsidies of public services.
              </p>
              <p>
                There appears to be unanimous agreement within the private sector regarding the devastating severity of the crisis. The latest market survey of expectations of the 30 largest consultants and banks in the country, carried out by the Central Bank, yielded an average estimate of an annual CPI increase of 95 percent. Many private analysts, however, are anticipating that the 100 percent barrier will be broken.
              </p>
              <p>
                INDEC said in a statement that the seven percent rise recorded in August represented a slight easing from the 7.4 percent figure posted in July, which was the highest monthly index of the last 20 years.

          <h4 class="heading">Chip Stocks Like Nvidia, Intel Keep Plunging to New Lows. It’s No Time to Bargain Hunt.</h4>
          <div class="articleText">
            <p>
              With semiconductor stocks tumbling again, some chip investors may think it is time to go bargain hunting. That is not a good idea
            </p>
            <p>
              While share prices are lower, the main problem is stocks are going down for legitimate reasons. And recent developments suggest business trends are getting worse—not better, meaning there could be more downside ahead.
            </pass=>
            <p>
              On Friday, investors were spooked about a potential global recession a day after FedEx ( FDX ) warned it would report weaker than expected profit results. In early trading, shares of two major chip companies—Intel and Nvidia NVDA +2.08%  —hit new lows with both now down about 45% and 55%, respectively, this year.
            </p>
            <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/U_MS9pAK46rc9UrLrg_Vmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTM1Mw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0Qh.MpEctsCjCNnpnohHEA--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMjgwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Barrons.com/f3ebbdd46cf398c871f2c46b1c450c77" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3 img-thumbnail blackNwhite giveMeColor p-2 rounded-4" alt="inflation">
          <p>
            It is important to remember if earnings outlooks come down, stocks can become more expensive on a valuation basis even if stock prices are falling. And the latest flurry of data points from chip companies hasn’t been ideal.</p>
          <p>
            Two weeks ago, Nvidia (ticker: NVDA ) said $400 million in potential sales to China for its current quarter could be affected by new export restrictions for its advanced AI data center chips.
          </p>
          <p>
            A week later, a senior executive at Samsung Electronics (ticker: 005930.Korea), the world’s largest maker of memory chips, said weak chip demand from its customers may be more persistent than the company had originally thought going into next year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then at technology conferences this week, executives at Western Digital ( WDC ) and Seagate ( STX ) suggested business conditions were still deteriorating, pointing to caution from cloud customers. This comes even after both companies had already cut forecasts by large margins just a few weeks ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, Intel INTC +1.39%  ( INTC ) CEO Pat Gelsinger also said at a conference last week “it’s pretty rough out there” and business may be a “little bit worse” since they gave guidance on second quarter earnings call in late July.
          </p>
          <p>
            With another round of cautious commentary on top of continued weak pricing for processors, memory chips, and graphics cards at retailers and used marketplaces, it looks likely demand for technology products isn’t improving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The incoming clouds for the semiconductor industry seem to be getting darker. For now, there is no upturn in sight.
